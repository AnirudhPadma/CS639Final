NutriRecipe Finder. It helps you eat healthy by finding recipes based on what nutrients you need. Want more protein? Less carbs? NutriRecipe Finder will search a giant recipe list (powered by Spoonacular) to find meals that fit the bill.

Here's how it might work:

Pick what you want: The app will ask you what nutrients you're looking for, maybe with buttons or sliders.
Search the recipe mountain: The app uses your choices to search a huge recipe list for perfect matches.
See yummy options: The app shows you recipes that fit your needs, with details like ingredients and instructions.
Save and share favorites: Like a recipe? Save it for later or share it with friends!
Adjust recipe size: Need to cook for more people? No problem! You can adjust the recipe to make the right amount.
